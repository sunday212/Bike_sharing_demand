Title: Predict bike rental demand               
Author: Lisa Mok

Dataset: Hourly rental data spanning 2 years, sourced from Kaggle 

Project Description: This exercise demonstrates the step-by-step machine learning process which involves data exploration, data processing, model selection, model tuning and evaluation to achieve the highest possible accuracy level in predicting bicycle rental demand.

Project Details: Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this exercise, I forecast bike rental demand for casual renters in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
